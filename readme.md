Webcamize allows you to use [basically any modern camera](./assets/supported.md) as a webcam on Linux‚Äîyour DSLR, mirrorless, camcorder, point-and-shoot, and even some smartphones/tablets. It also gets many webcams that don't work out of the box on Linux up and running in a flash.

There's literally only two steps...

**1‚Äã. Plug in your camera**

**2‚Äã. Run the `webcamize` command**

Now your camera is a webcam! üéâ
</div>

It's really that easy! Webcamize is a tiny bash script that coordinates [gphoto2](http://gphoto.org/) and [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) to capture video from any camera and output it to a live video device, ready to be used as a webcam. Whether it's for a Zoom meeting, a live streaming event, or a virtual conference, webcamize bridges the gap between high-end photography equipment and everyday tech usability.

## Using webcamize

<img src="./assets/usage.svg">

</div>

<br>

Webcamize is designed to be as easy to use as possible. Just plug in your camera, then run the script:

```console
$ webcamize
[INFO] Starting camera on /dev/video0
```

In the vast majority of cases, that's all you'll need to do. You might be asked to enter your password for `modprobe` to enable the video device.

[**View the list of supported cameras and devices**](./assets/supported.md).

### Advanced Usage

```console
$ webcamize --help
Usage: webcamize [OPTIONS...]
        -v, --version                   Print version info and quit
        -c, --camera NAME               Specify a gphoto2 camera to use; autodetects by default
        -d, --device NUMBER             Specify the /dev/video device number to use (default: 0)
        -g, --gphoto-args ARGS          Pass arguments to gphoto2 (default: "autofocusdrive=1")
        -f, --ffmpeg-args ARGS          Pass arguments to ffmpeg (default: "-vcodec rawvideo -pix_fmt yuv420p -threads 0")
        -l, --log-level LEVEL           Set the log level (INFO, WARN, FATAL; default: INFO)
        -h, --help                      Show this help message
```

#### Choosing a Different Camera

If you have multiple gphoto2 compatible cameras that are connected and available, you can specify the camera you want to use with the `--camera` flag. You can list the available cameras by running the following command:

```console
$ gphoto2 --summary | grep Model:
Model: Canon EOS 80D
Model: Sony Alpha-A7r III 
```

Once you know the name of the camera you want to use, just pass it to the `--camera` flag:

```console
$ webcamize --camera "Sony Alpha-A7r III"
[INFO] Starting Sony Alpha-A7r III on /dev/video0
```

#### Setting a Different Video Device

Want to use your camera as a webcam on `/dev/video4` instead of the default `/dev/video0`? Easy-peasy! Just set the `--device` flag:

```console
$ webcamize --device 4
[INFO] Starting camera on /dev/video4
```

#### Multi-Camera Setup

Alright mister show biz, here's how you can do a multiple camera setup; first, unload the v4l2loopback module and reload it for a multi-camera setup. The demo below suggests a three camera setup.

```console
$ modprobe -r v4l2loopback
$ modprobe v4l2loopback devices=3 video_nr=2,3,4 card_label="Canon EOS 80D,Sony Alpha-A7r III,Nikon Z8" exclusive_caps=1,1,1
```

Once that's done, just chain together the `--device` and `--camera` flags to route multiple cameras into the multiple video devices you just created.

```console
$ webcamize --device 2 --camera "Canon EOS 80D" &
[INFO] Starting Canon EOS 80D on /dev/video4
$ webcamize --device 3 --camera "Sony Alpha-A7r III" &
[INFO] Starting Sony Alpha-A7r III on /dev/video3
$ webcamize --device 4 --camera "Nikon Z8" &
[INFO] Starting Nikon Z8 on /dev/video2
```

If you want to learn more about how to configure the v4l2loopback module, refer to the [Arch Linux wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/V4l2loopback).

#### Custom Arguments for gphoto2/ffmpeg

Unless you're really familiar with gphoto2/ffmpeg, it's inadvisable to pass custom arguments with the `--gphoto-args` and `--ffmpeg-args` flags; all these flags do is pass arguments into their respective command. As an example, here's the default flags for ffmpeg but edited to have a different thread count:

```console
$ webcamize --ffmpeg-args "-vcodec rawvideo -pix_fmt yuv420p -threads 2"
webcamize: Starting camera on /dev/video0
```

### Enabling Webcamize on Startup

First, [install webcamize](#installation)! Then, you can make webcamize run by default on startup with a systemd unit file included in the git repository; all you need to do is symlink it to your system services folder.

From the webcamize repository:

```console
$ ln -s "$PWD/webcamize.service" /etc/systemd/system/
```

Then, just enable it!

```console
$ systemctl enable webcamize
Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/webcamize.service ‚Üí /etc/systemd/system/webcamize.service.
```

Webcamize should now run in the background automatically when you start up your PC.

### Package Managers

Webcamize is brand new and probably not available via your distribution's package manager (yet)‚Äîif you want to support the project by maintaining a package for webcamize, I'd be eternally grateful!

#### Arch Linux (AUR)

Webcamize is available from the [Arch User Repository](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/webcamize) as `webcamize`

```console
$ yay -S webcamize
```

<!-- #### NixOS (Nixpkgs)

Webcamize can be found in [Nixpkgs](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/webcamize) as `webcamize`

```console
$ nix-env -iA webcamize
``` -->

### Manual Installation

Webcamize is super easy to install‚Äîit only has a few additional dependencies that you should make sure are installed before beginning:

- [gphoto2](http://gphoto.org/)
- [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/)
- [v4l2loopback](https://github.com/umlaeute/v4l2loopback)

These should be available from your package manager.

#### Installation Instructions

**1. To get started, clone this repo somewhere**

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/weebney/webcamize && cd webcamize
```

**2. Link the script somewhere on your path**

> [!WARNING]
> You will probably have to run the command below with `sudo`! Remember to double check what commands are doing if you're copying them from the internet, **especially** if they want you to use root privileges!

```console
$ ln -s "$PWD/webcamize" /usr/local/bin/
```

**That's all; you're ready to go!** üéâüéâ

Give it a quick test just to make sure it's working:

```console
$ webcamize &
$ ffplay /dev/video0
```

#### Updating Webcamize

To update webcamize, just run the following command from the webcamize git repo:

```console
$ git fetch --tags && git checkout $(git describe --tags $(git rev-list --tags --max-count=1))
```

This should upgrade you to the latest tagged version.

This is just a little script I cooked up one afternoon‚Äîthe software it depends on is where the real magic happens. It's important that we remind ourselves that we stand on the shoulders of giants; with that being said, a big thanks goes out from me to:

- [Michael Niedermayer](https://github.com/michaelni) and all other contributors to [ffmpeg](https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg/graphs/contributors) for their incredible work on the absolute behemoth that is ffmpeg.
- [Marcus Meissner](https://github.com/msmeissn),  [Hans Niedermann](https://github.com/ndim), and the other contributors to [gphoto2](https://github.com/gphoto/gphoto2) and [libgphoto2](https://github.com/gphoto/libgphoto2). This project is quite obscure given the insane quality and scope‚Äîit has the polish of a project with significantly more steam behind it. Definitely check it out!
- [You](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_(Time_Person_of_the_Year)), the reader! Thank you for using, supporting, and contributing to webcamize; without you, this project would not be possible.
