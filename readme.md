Webcamize allows you to use [basically any modern camera](./doc/supported.md) as a webcam on Linux‚Äîyour DSLR, mirrorless, camcorder, point-and-shoot, and even some smartphones/tablets. It also gets many webcams that don't work out of the box on Linux up and running in a flash.

There's literally only two steps...

## Using webcamize

<img src="./doc/assets/usage.svg">

</div>

<br>

Webcamize is designed to be as easy to use as possible. Just plug in your camera, turn it on, then run the `webcamize` command:

```console
$ webcamize
```

In the vast majority of cases, that's all you'll need to do. You might be asked to enter your password to enable and configure the video device.

[**View the list of supported cameras and devices**](./doc/supported.md).

## Installation

### Package Managers

> [!NOTE]
> Webcamize is a small hobby project and probably not available via your distribution's package manager (yet)‚Äîif you want to support the project by maintaining a package for webcamize, I'd be eternally grateful.

<div align="right">
  
[![Packaging status](https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/webcamize.svg)](https://repology.org/project/webcamize/versions)

</div>

#### Arch Linux (AUR)

Webcamize is available from the [Arch User Repository](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/webcamize) as `webcamize`

```console
$ yay -S webcamize
```

<!-- #### Nix & NixOS (Nixpkgs)

Webcamize can be found in [Nixpkgs](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/webcamize) as `webcamize`

```console
$ nix-env -iA webcamize
``` -->

### Building From Source

Webcamize has a few additional dependencies that you should make sure are installed before beginning:

- [libgphoto2](https://repology.org/project/libgphoto2/versions)
- [ffmpeg (libavutil, libavcodec, libavformat, libswscale)](https://repology.org/project/ffmpeg/versions)
- [v4l2loopback DKMS](https://repology.org/projects/?search=v4l2loopback)
- [libkmod](https://repology.org/project/kmod/versions)
- Linux headers

These should be available from your package manager.

**1. To get started, clone this repo somewhere**

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/cowtoolz/webcamize && cd webcamize
```

You don't have to, but you should check out a tag. To checkout the latest tag automatically:

```console
$ git checkout $(git describe --tags $(git rev-list --tags --max-count=1))
```

**2. Build Webcamize**

Webcamize doesn't require any configuration; you can just run `make`.

```console
$ make
```

**2. Install Webcamize**

If `~/.local/bin/` is on your path, you can use the `install-local` target‚Äîotherwise, use the normal `install` target:

```console
$ echo $PATH | grep -q ~/.local/bin && make install-local || sudo make install
```

Webcamize can be uninstalled with the `uninstall-local` and `uninstall` targets respectively, but if you installed it from source you should be able to safely `rm $(which webcamize)`.

**That's all; you're ready to go!** üéâüéâ

Webcamize does little more than orchestrate other open source software; the software it depends on is where the real magic happens. With that being said, a big thanks goes out from me to:

- [Michael Niedermayer](https://github.com/michaelni) and other contributors to [ffmpeg](https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg/graphs/contributors) for their incredible work on the absolute behemoth that is ffmpeg.
- [Marcus Meissner](https://github.com/msmeissn), [Hans Niedermann](https://github.com/ndim), and the other contributors to [libgphoto2](https://github.com/gphoto/libgphoto2). This project is underrated given the insane quality and scope.
- [You](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_(Time_Person_of_the_Year)>), the reader! Thank you for using, supporting, and contributing to webcamize; without you, this project would not be possible.
